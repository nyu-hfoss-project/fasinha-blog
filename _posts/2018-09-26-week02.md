# Week 2 - Working on Blog Formatting and Learning about Issues/Pull Requests
Updates: I had some trouble setting up the blogs, because of the strange merging problems I had last week and the fact that I accidentally didn't accept the invitation on GitHub. 
- I received some issues from the other students and some of them I have resolved by merging pull requests. 
So far, the projects I am leaning towards are: 

1) OpenMRS 
2) Open Street Maps 
3) Sugar Labs 
4) Still not sure! 

- I edited my previous blog posts with the update to the user base ranking on Open Street Maps, and I also edited the links to make them more accessible to others. 

- I was wondering if we could go over issue reporting again (maybe I am the only one having this problem with issue reporting?) 
- I also can't get the HTML formatting to work
