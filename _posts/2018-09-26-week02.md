# Week 2 - Working on Blog Formatting and Learning about Issues/Pull Requests
Updates: I had some trouble setting up the blogs, because of the strange merging problems I had last week and the fact that I accidentally didn't accept the invitation on GitHub. 
- I received some issues from the other students and some of them I have resolved by merging pull requests. 
So far, the projects I am leaning towards are: 
1) OpenMRS 
2) Open Street Maps
