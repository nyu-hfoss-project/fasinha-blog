# Week 3 - Finding Issues 

The projects that we have decided to focus on (for the time being are Open MRS, Astropy and Open Street Maps)

# OPENMRS 

https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-owa-oncology/issues -- 
I am really interested in this section of Open MRS!
- "The goal of this project is to add chemotherapy regimen support to OpenMRS EMR system so that doctors can order and track a patient's chemo treatment from EMR system."
- There are 9 issues, and I think this module also has a Python version, so if anyone is more comfortable with Python than Java, this could be a good option too.

# OPEN STREET MAPS 
https://github.com/osmlab/atlas/issues
- This implements something called Atlas which "efficiently represents OSM in memory"
- There are currently 13 unresolved issues
- They want people to implement functions (tree flattening), which seems really interesting 
https://github.com/osmlab/maproulette3
- I think this is a bug fixing tool in and of itself (?)
- 68 issues 
- they have a good guide for how to contribute.
