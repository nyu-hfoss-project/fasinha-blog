# Assessing Issues More Specifically
## Relationships to Presets: Open Street Map

This past week I looked more closely at one of the issues that we went over last week, which I think Isabelle talked about.
[Adding Relationships to Presets -- Open Street Map](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/issues/5326).

I really liked the clarity of this issue and I spent most of my time trying to understand presets -- this issue linked to a lot of 
other related issues that also had some really good examples for what the collaborators are looking for. 
Click [here](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/issues/4139) for some examples of good preset relationships. 

I forked the iD repository so that I can start working on it -- the issue suggested that it might be good to establish rankings for preset relationships, which could help distinguish stronger versus weaker relationships between presets. So far I have not contributed 
anything substantial because I am having a little bit of trouble with the JavaScript syntax, but I am working on potential rankings
that could be added.

For testing, I made some simple changes to this file [hospital](https://github.com/fasinha/iD/blob/master/data/presets/presets/amenity/hospital.json). Essentially, I modified the "related terms" 
section, by adding terms like "medicine" and "medication" in order to further specify the nature of the hospital.
