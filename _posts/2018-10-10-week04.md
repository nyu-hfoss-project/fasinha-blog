Title: Week 4 -- Trying to Set Up Open MRS

- Tried to work on Open MRS Oncology module, but having some trouble cloning the repository and installing the appropriate packages.
- I think this may have something to do with the fact that I am not running Linux on my machine (?) 
- I have been using the Virtual Box from CSO last semester, but I'm not entirely sure if this is appropriate.

- Another idea that I think we might discuss today is the possibility of applying for a DURF grant 
- I know they have team research grants, but some questions to discuss might include: how oculd the money be used for HFOSS? 
how might we package it into an appropriate research project?
