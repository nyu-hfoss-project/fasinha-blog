# Week 5 - Trying to Set Up Astropy and Hacktoberfest

- I am still having some trouble with Python -- even though I changed the path environment variable, it is still not letting me get
past this line: python setup.py build. 

- I am able to run Astropy from Anaconda (Python), so I think I am getting it to work through the Anaconda platform. 

- I have been looking at the following issue: [https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues/7902], but I have not made any actual contribution.
- Most of my work this week has been sifting through issues and trying to see which ones I am able to understand and make sense of. 

- This is the tutorial I followed: [http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/development/workflow/git_edit_workflow_examples.html]

- I learned more about Hacktoberfest, and did a search on Github:
  - [https://github.com/fasinha/Hacktoberfest-Data-Structure-and-Algorithms] --> has really good instructions on how to contribute.
  - I followed the instructions and I added my name to the Contributors list and forked.
