# Week 5 - Trying to Set Up Astropy

- I am still having some trouble with Python -- even though I changed the path environment variable, it is still not letting me get
past this line: python setup.py build. 

- I am able to run Astropy from Anaconda (Python), so I think I am getting it to work through the Anaconda platform. 

- I have been looking at the following issue: https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues/7902, but I have not made any actual contribution.
- Most of my work this week has been sifting through issues and trying to see which ones I am able to understand and make sense of. 

- This is the tutorial I followed: http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/development/workflow/git_edit_workflow_examples.html
